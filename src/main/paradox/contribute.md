# How to contribute

I would be happy about feedback from people who tried this library out, and especially about any contributions to get over the [current limitations](status.md).

Development of the project takes place [on GitHub](https://github.com/dwestheide/kontextfrei). If you find a bug, or have a suggestion for an improvement, please create a GitHub issue or make a pull request.
